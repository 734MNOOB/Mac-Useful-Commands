## Homebrew Services

Integrates Homebrew formulae with macOS's `launchctl` manager.

By default, plists are installed to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` and run as the
current user upon login.  When `brew services` is run as the root user, plists
are installed to `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`, and run as the root user on boot.

## Installation ##
`brew tap homebrew/services`

### List all services managed by `brew services` ###
`$ brew services list`

### Run/start/stop/restart all available services ###
`$ brew services run|start|stop|restart --all`
